    "How KOT Works": `⚙️ HOW KOT WORKS — STEP BY STEP

KOT (Kitchen Order Ticket) is the backbone of Bireena Atithi's food service automation.

📱 FLOW 1 — QR CODE ORDERING (In-Room):
1. Hotel admin generates QR code per room from Property Setup → Generate Room QR
2. QR code is printed and placed on the room door
3. Guest scans QR using their mobile phone (no app or login required)
4. Guest sees the live food menu on their phone
5. Guest selects items and places the order
6. ✅ KOT is automatically generated instantly
7. KOT appears on the kitchen display/printer
8. Kitchen staff prepares the food
9. Status updated: Pending → In Progress → Served
10. Charges are auto-added to the guest's folio
11. Guest pays at the time of checkout

🍽️ FLOW 2 — WAITER / TABLE ORDERING:

4. Adds food items from the digital menu
5. Enters any special instructions
6. Clicks Submit
7. ✅ KOT is instantly generated and sent to kitchen

10. Guest requests bill → Cashier generates final bill

🔄 MULTIPLE ROUNDS:

• All rounds are linked to the same table/room bill

📊 OVERALL FLOW SUMMARY:
Order Placed → KOT Generated → Kitchen Receives → Prepares → Serves → Bill Ready`,

    "Folio & Bill Splitting": `📄 FOLIO & BILLING MANAGEMENT

Every guest has a "Folio" — a virtual account that tracks all their expenses (Room, Food, Laundry, etc.).

✂️ HOW TO SPLIT A BILL / ROUTE FOLIO:
If a guest wants to pay for certain items separately (e.g. food on one bill, room on another):
1. Login → Folio Management
2. Search and select the Guest Name/Room
3. Click on the "Route Folio" or "Split Bill" button
4. You will see two columns (Main Folio and Sub-Folio)
5. Select the items you want to move (e.g., KOT #102)
6. Click the arrow button to Move to Sub-Folio
7. Save changes → Now you can generate two separate invoices for the same guest!

🔄 MERGING BILLS:
If you want to combine multiple room bills into one:
1. Open Folio Management → Master Folio
2. Select rooms to be linked
3. Click "Merge to Master"
4. All charges will now appear on a single total invoice.`,

    "Check-out Process": `🚪 CHECK-OUT & FINAL SETTLEMENT

Follow these steps to complete a guest stay:
1. Go to Folio Management → Search Room Number
2. Review all charges (Room, F&B, Minibar, Taxes)
3. Click "Accept Payment" → Select Mode (Cash/Card/UPI)
4. Once total balance is ₹0, click "Complete Check-out"
5. Room status instantly changes to "Dirty" (Housekeeping notified)
6. Print/Email the GST-compliant Tax Invoice to the guest.`,

    "Table Splitting": `✂️ HOW TO SPLIT A TABLE

Table View → Select Occupied Table → More Options → Split Table → Select Items to Move → Save Changes.`,
